# Certification program

## 1. Description

- Authentication includes: client authentication and site authentication

- Authentication configuration: ```$FATE_BASE/conf/service_conf.yaml```.

  ```yaml
  ## Site authentication requires configuration of the party site id
  party_id:
  # Hook module, need to configure different hooks according to different scenarios
  hook_module:
    client_authentication: fate_flow.hook.flow.client_authentication
    site_authentication: fate_flow.hook.flow.site_authentication
  # Third-party authentication service name
  hook_server_name:
  authentication:
    client:
      # Client authentication switch
      switch: false
      http_app_key:
      http_secret_key:
    site:
      # Site authentication switch
      switch: false
  ```
  
- Authentication method: Support flow's own authentication module authentication and third-party service authentication. The authentication hooks can be modified by hook_module, currently the following hooks are supported.
  - client_authentication supports "fate_flow.hook.flow.client_authentication" and "fate_flow.hook.api.client_authentication", where the former is the client authentication method of flow. the former is the client authentication method of flow, the latter is the client authentication method of third-party services.
  - site_authentication supports "fate_flow.hook.flow.site_authentication" and "fate_flow.hook.api.site_authentication", where the former is the site authentication method of flow and the latter is the third-party The former is the site authentication method of flow, and the latter is the third-party site authentication method.
	

## 2. client authentication

### 2.1 flow authentication
#### 2.1.1 Configuration
```yaml
hook_module:
  client_authentication: fate_flow.hook.flow.client_authentication
authentication:
  client:
    switch: true
    http_app_key: "xxx"
    http_secret_key: "xxx"
```



#### 2.2.2 Interface Authentication Method

All client requests sent to Flow need to add the following header
```

`TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp in milliseconds, e.g. `1634890066095` means `2021-10-22 16:07:46 GMT+0800`, note that the difference between this time and the current time of the server cannot exceed 60 seconds

`NONCE`: random string, can use UUID, such as `782d733e-330f-11ec-8be9-a0369fa972af`

`APP_KEY`: must be consistent with `http_app_key` in the Flow configuration file

`SIGNATURE`: signature generated based on `http_secret_key` and request parameters in the Flow configuration file

```
#### 2.2.3 Signature generation method

- Combine the following elements in order

`TIMESTAMP`

`NONCE`

`APP_KEY`

request path + query parameters, if there are no query parameters then the final `? `, such as `/v1/job/submit` or `/v1/data/upload?table_name=dvisits_hetero_guest&namespace=experiment`

If `Content-Type` is `application/json`, then it is the original JSON, i.e. the request body; if not, this item is filled with the empty string

If `Content-Type` is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, all parameters need to be sorted alphabetically and `urlencode`, refer to RFC 3986 (i.e. except `a-zA-Z0-9- . _~`), note that the file does not participate in the signature; if not, this item is filled with the empty string

- Concatenate all parameters with the newline character `\n` and encode them in `ASCII`.

- Use the `HMAC-SHA1` algorithm to calculate the binary digest using the `http_secret_key` key in the Flow configuration file

- Encode the binary digest using base64

#### 2.2.4 Example

You can refer to [Fate SDK](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE/blob/master/python/fate_client/flow_sdk/client/base.py#L63)

### 2.2 Third party service authentication
#### 2.2.1 Configuration
```yaml
hook_module:
  client_authentication: fate_flow.hook.api.client_authentication
authentication:
  client:
    switch: true
hook_server_name: "xxx"
```

#### 2.2.2 Interface Authentication Method
- The third party service needs to register the client authentication interface with flow, refer to [Client Authentication Service Registration](./third_party_service_registry.md#321-client-authentication-client_authentication)
- If the authentication fails, flow will return the authentication failure directly to the client.

## 3. Site Authentication

### 3.1 flow authentication

#### 3.1.1 Configuration
```yaml
party_id: 9999
hook_module:
  site_authentication: fate_flow.hook.flow.site_authentication
authentication:
  client:
    switch: true
    http_app_key: "xxx"
    http_secret_key: "xxx"
```

#### 3.1.2 Authentication scheme
- flow generates a pair of public and private keys when it starts, and needs to exchange public keys with each other with its partners. When sending a request, it uses the public key to generate a signature by RSA algorithm, and the requested site verifies the signature by its co-key.
- flow provides a key management cli as follows

#### 3.1.3 Key Management
- Add the partner's public key

{{snippet('cli/key.md', '### save')}}

- Delete a partner's public key

{{snippet('cli/key.md', '### delete')}}


- Query the co-key

{{snippet('cli/key.md', '### query')}}

### 3.2 Third-party service authentication
#### 3.2.1 Configuration
```yaml
hook_module:
  site_authentication: fate_flow.hook.api.site_authentication
authentication:
  site:
    switch: true
hook_server_name: "xxx"
```

#### 3.2.2 Interface Authentication Method
- Third party services need to register the site authentication interface with flow, refer to [site authentication service registration](./third_party_service_registry.md#3222-site_authentication)
- If the authentication fails, flow will directly return the authentication failure to the initiator.
