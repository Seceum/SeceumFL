flow init --ip 192.168.0.1 --port 9380
```

### via the configuration file on the FATE cluster

```shell
### Go to the FATE installation path, e.g. /data/projects/fate
cd $FATE_PROJECT_BASE/
flow init -c conf/service_conf.yaml
```

The initialization is considered successful if you get the following return.

```json
{
    "retcode": 0,
    "retmsg": "Fate Flow CLI has been initialized successfully."
}
```

## Verify

Mainly verify that the client can connect to the `FATE Flow Server`, e.g. try to query the current job status

```bash
flow job query
```

Usually the `retcode` in the return is `0`.

```json
{
    "data": [],
    "retcode": 0,
    "retmsg": "no job could be found"
}
```

If it returns something like the following, it means that the connection is not available, please check the network situation

```json
{
    "retcode": 100,
    "retmsg": "Connection refused. Please check if the fate flow service is started"
}
```
